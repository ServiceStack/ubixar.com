We're excited to introduce **Ubixar** — an open and free AI generation platform where creativity meets community-powered computing.

## What is Ubixar?

Ubixar is a platform built around [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), the powerful node-based interface for Stable Diffusion and other AI image generation models. But we've taken it further — creating an ecosystem where users can **share**, **discover**, and **run** ComfyUI workflows without needing their own GPU.

Whether you're an AI artist looking to share your creative workflows, a curious explorer wanting to generate stunning images, or someone with spare GPU power looking to contribute to the community — Ubixar has a place for you.

## Free to Use, Community Powered

Ubixar is **completely free** to use. Every day, credits are made available to all users, allowing anyone to generate AI images using the workflows shared on the platform. No subscriptions, no paywalls — just pure creative freedom.

But here's where it gets interesting: Ubixar runs on a **distributed GPU grid** powered by the community itself.

## Share Your GPU, Earn Priority

Have a powerful GPU sitting idle? Connect it to the Ubixar grid and let others run their generations on your hardware. In return, you'll earn credits that give you **higher priority** in future AI generation queues.

This creates a virtuous cycle:
- **GPU contributors** get faster access to generations
- **The community** gets more computing power
- **Everyone** benefits from a growing, sustainable platform

## Create Popular Content, Rise to the Top

Credits aren't just for GPU contributors. When you create workflows or generate images that resonate with the community, you earn credits too. The more popular your creations become, the higher your priority climbs.

This means the most creative and engaged members of the community naturally rise to the top of the queue — rewarding quality and participation over everything else.

## How the Queue Works

The generation queue is ordered by credits earned. Users who have:
- **Contributed GPU time** to the grid
- **Created popular generations** that others love
- **Shared workflows** that the community uses

...all get priority access when the queue is busy. It's a fair system that rewards those who give back to the platform.

## Open Source, Open Community

Ubixar is built on open source principles. The platform itself, along with all supporting agents, is available on GitHub:

- [ubixar.com](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ubixar.com) — The main platform
- [comfy-agent](https://github.com/ServiceStack/comfy-agent) — The ComfyUI agent for connecting GPUs
- [classifier-agent](https://github.com/ServiceStack/classifier-agent) — Content classification agent

We believe in transparency and community ownership. User contributions are licensed under [CC BY-SA](/licensing), ensuring that the creative work shared here remains accessible to all.
